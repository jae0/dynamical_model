\renewcommand{\maketitlehookd}{%
	\begin{abstract}
		\noindent Snow crab (\emph{Chionoecetes opilio}) are cold-water
		stenotherms in the northern hemisphere. As they are long-lived and have
		a complex life history, developing an operational model of population
		dynamics has been a challenge, especially in the context of human
		exploitation and rapid global climate change. Here we review past
		efforts at understanding the population dynamics of snow crab in an
		environmentally and spatiotemporally heterogeneous area, the Scotian
		Shelf of the northwest Atlantic of Canada. We address these difficulties
		with a moderately complex multi-stage, delay differential model and
		parameterize it leveraging Bayesian techniques. Operational solutions
		were stable and reasonable and permitted inference upon the intra-annual
		dynamics of snow crab. Further, a concept of a \emph{Fisheries footprint},
		akin to fishing mortality, can be elucidated that directly addresses the
		conceptual impact of a fishery upon a population. The approach is
		promising. The model suggests additional processes need to be accounted
		that contributes to the \emph{non-well-mixed} nature of the model system.
		We hypothesize that seasonal and interannual movement and
		spatiotemporally structured predation are key processes that require
		further attention. However, as computational costs are significant,
		these additional processes will need to be parameterized carefully.
	\end{abstract}

), the largest of males (> 95 mm carapace width) are preferentially captured due to their higher meat-yield and consumer preferences of larger claws, a trait that occurs only at the terminal molt to maturity. This market-driven protection for the female reproductive crab which never reaches such sizes and the smaller immature crab represents a form of built-in protection for the population which spans 10 years of age or more, from larval release; it helps to offset otherwise heavy exploitation pressures. However, extreme exploitation of mature males by fishers with advanced technological and historical knowledge of their environment and the species' aggregation patterns, enable them to target their efforts in time and space and significantly magnify their influence. Currently, every known population of snow crab is exploited by humans, most using technologically informed approaches. As such, it is imperative that exploitation occurs in a responsible and sustainable manner.

)). This is because they are long lived and have a complex life history. Ultimately this translates into large vertical and horizontal shifts in spatial distributions as they grow older (ontogenetic shift in habitat). Functionally, they participate in the pelagic and subsequently benthic ecosystems and associated nutrient and carbon cycles. They also have a narrow range of environmental preferences which coincide with highly variable ocean climates rendering them a challenge to sample. The additional factors of global rapid climate and ecosystem change make this understanding even more difficult. Some of the notable life history features of snow crab that make them so interesting but difficult to model, include: sexual dimorphism with mature males being much larger than mature females; pelagic larval stages and benthic pre-adolescent and adult stages; semi-annual and annual molts depending upon size, age and environmental conditions; terminal molt to maturity; and longevity up to 15 years. They also have a narrow range of temperature preferences

In short, sampling in an unbiased manner under complex hydrodynamic conditions is particularly difficult as the random stratified sampling (i.e., spatial) that is usually adopted to account for such variability, fail to do so due to the large dynamic (i.e.,spatiotemporal) structures operating on scales comparable to the domain. A model-based approach (

This study focuses upon the indices of abundance derived from this process for the period from 1999 to 2022. Importantly, no survey was conducted in 2020 due to Covid-19 related uncertainties. The index generation method being Bayesian, imputes these estimates, but variability attached to this year is large. These aggregate timeseries data and supporting

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There have only been a small number of attempts at modeling the dynamics of snow crab populations. Being long-lived, sexually dimorphic, deep water, benthic organisms, usually living far offshore, they are not easily surveyed. Snow crab have a complex life history that spans up to 15 years from planktonic to benthic stages. They molt 2 times a year in the early stages and then approximately annually by instar 5 (about 15 mm carapace width) and can even skip molts when living conditions are poor. This life history complexity causes complexity in their dynamics and spatial distributions. Most population assessments approach abundance estimation as a fishery- or survey-based relative index of a narrow segment of the population (the fishable component). When modeled, these empirical estimates of abundance are assumed to be known without bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further, aging of snow crab is not possible due to a lack of retention of calcified body parts through molts. This has encouraged adoption of size-based models

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 assume the male fishable component is the spawning stock biomass, though of course it is the females that are the reproductive component and completely unexploited with a shorter life span. Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 implicitly assumes that the fishable biomass regenerates itself by application of a biomass dynamics model. Importantly, sex and size-selectivity of sampling gear are almost always assumed to be a constant or some smooth monotonic function of body size, and so static across time and space. These are significant and biologically problematic assumptions. The problems encountered are fundamental issues shared with all other attempts at assessment. Specifically, they are the interplay between snow crab life history and behavior; our inability to observe them without bias due to sampling design being non-random with respects to the environmental factors controlling their distribution and abundance; and the sampling machinery (mesh size, trawls that cannot access rugose areas) that can only observe a small fraction of the population.

\end_inset

 to give:

Of course, there is usually observation error and/or illegal removals that will get erroneously absorbed as a biological process; in this case by elevating the intrinsic rate of increase to compensate for the additional losses. This will have an effect of creating bias and uncertainty in related parameters (see below). Note also that the discretization to an annual basis is a significant assumption as the time span is large relative to the processes of most biota. This has the effect of averaging out sub-annual dynamics. This means temporal aliasing or discretization errors and censoring are introduced which ultimately increases process and observation errors (see subannual dynamics, below).

In reality, there are biological mechanisms involved and associated parameters that are not-static and non-stationary (in first and second order; across time and space). Growth in biomass or increase in numbers is seasonal and pulsed, due to the molting process and body mass increases, that progress at variable rates depending upon time of year and environmental variability. Across years, there are strong and weak year classes due to match-mismatch type processes

creates
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fishable biomass at a maximum exponential rate (r) to a limit of K. In reality, fishable biomass being mature male snow crab, does not produce more mature male snow crab; instead, it is the female mature population that creates the eggs and broods them to larvae, some fraction of which eventually mature into the fishable component. The dynamics and longevity of these females are very different from those of the males, often showing unbalanced sex ratios and differential utilization of habitat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

. The rate of increase in biomass is not a simple exponential rate; instead, a certain number of fishable crab die from various causes (predation, disease, competitive fighting), a certain number of recruits terminally molt to a size in the fishable range to increase their numbers, they grow in weight as they eat, some fraction move in and out of a given area, and some are fished; these rates are not constant in time nor space and there are many lags in time.

 from the perspective of

These constraints unfortunately result in a model that is sometimes not responsive enough to large fluctuations in dynamics caused by intrinsic and/or extrinsic factors.

stage
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 is defined based upon size-sex-morphometric traits and so misclassification is likely. The error in such knife-edge stage determinations can be substantial if growth and maturity schedules vary significantly. It is assumed, here, that in the aggregate, this has been stable in the survey record (1999 to 2021). This may of course be incorrect if persistent size/stage/age related mortality occurs due to exploitation/predation patterns and/or directional environmental change such as climate warming or food availability shifts.

\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

) will be large enough to be considered a fishable size (

\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

); this would result in a reduced molt transition rate. 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{2}$
\end_inset

 will represent a composite group of most crab that have entered fishable size but are still immature. Some fraction of this group will mature into the fishable component in the next year; the fractional nature will result in a smaller molt transition rate. Others will continue to molt to instar 13 and higher; for our purposes, all morphologically mature males of fishable size will be considered 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{1}$
\end_inset

 and so it represents a range of different ages. This is especially the case as terminally molted crab can live for up to another 5 years; this aggregation will effectively decrease mortality rate of the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey sampling and estimation of instar 9 to 13+ (40 mm to 130+ mm carapace width) is reasonably informative. Earlier instars tend to have more divergent habitat preferences relative to those of the fishable component and are also known to be poorly/erratically sampled due to their being small enough to be significantly affected by sampling mesh size. This is because the snow crab surveys are primarily optimized for sampling the fishable component (

The utility of these additional compartments is that they also permit more stable parameter estimation and forward projections that are biologically more reasonable (mechanistic). The challenge is to keep track of much more information due to the increased realism and computational limits. Each state variable 
\begin_inset Formula $U={({M_{1},M_{2},M_{3},M_{4},M_{5},F})}$

Visual observation of trawl operation through video monitoring have shown that crabs are missed: when they are in a slight depression, when they are close to protruding rocks or on bedrock, when bottom topography is complex or simply by the gear jumping off of the bottom due to tidal currents. That is, sampling gear is biased. Furthermore, it is not just sampling gear that is problematic. Survey design is biased: in design, each areal unit is expected to be homogeneous in space AND time. External factors being factored out such as bottom temperatures, food availability and predation, aggregation behavior are not homogeneous, no matter how well designed a sampling design may be. Further, there is the notion of

It is important to note that 
\emph on
Model 1
\emph default
 will project an increase in abundance, even if recruitment does not exist. It will only project a decline if abundance is above carrying capacity. This structural expectation is of course unrealistic. 
\emph on
Model 2
\emph default
, which accounts for recruitment, navigates this problem a little more sensibly as increase can only occur if recruitment exceed mortality. For example, it projects for 4X, a decline, even in the absence of fishing. In SENS, abundance is projected to increase slightly in the absence of fishing. Only NENS was projected to have a rapid increase in abundance (Figure

\begin_layout Standard
Another observation is that abundance may be overestimated by 
\emph on
Model 1
\emph default
. For example, in 4X where we have supporting information of very high natural mortality rates associated with predation and environmental variability, through the loss of strong year classes, abundance estimates are extremely optimistic. The same issues also exist for N-ENS, where strong adolescent crab year classes seem to disappear at a rate faster than might be expected, possibly due to predation. By extension, S-ENS also likely exhibits overly optimistic time trends, given the very strong year classes diminishing rapidly before entry into the fishable component. As a result of this potential overestimation of abundance, fishing mortality estimates by 
\emph on
Model 1
\emph default
 may in fact be overly low. 
\emph on
Model 2
\emph default
's solutions seem more reasonable given the supporting contextual information known of the different areas. The overall relative shapes of abundance and fishing mortality are, however, similar (Figure

) suggests that during the fishing season, the rate of exploitation far surpasses the slower rate of growth of the fishable component. It also identifies how important temporal aliasing might be if observations of landings or survey sample times are not properly accounted. The fishery footprint across the different areas (Figure

\emph on
Fishery footprint
\emph default
 also has a reasonably direct relationship to a question that is often asked in applied situations: 
\emph on
How much of an effect is fishing activity having?
\emph default
 In the case of the areas studied, the fishery footprint has declined to conservative and manageable levels since the mid-2000's. SENS, in particular, has been consistently sustainable in the historical record. In the presence of strong environmental variability, it will be necessary to continue to maintain a small fisheries footprint such that the species does not undergo extreme changes in abundance as has been the case for many collapsing fisheries, such as Atlantic cod. This is especially the case as heavy exploitation in the long-term can result in reduced reproductive success of females; loss of dominance by invasion of habitat by competitors and even genetic/phenotypic selection for reduced size at maturity

\begin_layout Standard
In studies of exploited marine animal populations, most models focus upon age structure 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

. Most also tend to be temporally discrete (annual) difference equation approximations. This is largely due to the annual cycle in temperate regions of exploitation, and data assimilation, survey and assessment cycles and historically due to limitations to computational capacity. With such discretizations, come various approximations and assumptions and ultimately potential error or bias from temporal (and spatial) aliasing. Space is treated as an externality or more usually, completely ignored, though of course, advection-diffusion differential equation models are readily formulated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The continuous approach that we developed in this study addresses mechanisms in a structured manner. The additional model complexity succeeds in providing a similar and perhaps more reasonable understanding of snow crab population dynamics than the classical biomass dynamics model. It also permits a promising way forward towards describing the footprint of a fishery measured relative to potential abundance in the absence of fishing. It also identifies that there are difficulties that need to be addressed: most notably the 
\emph on
non-well-mixed
\emph default
 nature of the areas studied show spatial and temporal structures that require further parameterization and development.

Population dynamics can be studied in many ways. Arguably, the simplest is to see it as a single component such as the total number of individuals, as in the logistic equation (eq. 1). Such single component models have a long tradition

. This is a 
\emph on
phenomenological

 perspective in that it abstracts a multitude of processes and interactions into very few externally facing parameters and one state variable (population size).

 perspective, as it is a continuum. For example, ecophysiological models characterize the average aggregate level processes under the assumption that individual-level metabolic rates (e.g., per capita rates of consumption, egestion, excretion, respiration, predation, somatic, gonadal growth, etc.) are relevant to aggregate level estimates to create mass-balance, mean-field type models

\begin_layout Standard
When this discrimination extends to each individual with equally unique rules of interactions for every individual, these models are known as 
\emph on
individual-based
\emph default
 models. They too are simple, but this simplicity is in the types of interactions rather than the number of components. With increasing specificity, the interactions become biologically more recognizable mechanisms: this individual grew X cm, this individual died at Y years, this individual reproduced and gave birth to N females, and this individual moved D km to find good habitat. Some individuals will grow faster and this has consequences upon other aspects of their interactions with other organisms and reproduction and death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though simple in concept, the application of 
\emph on
individual-based
\emph default
 models is actually quite difficult in that the rules need to be carefully constructed to describe correlated mean processes and also the variability between individuals. The rules thus tend to be probabilistic and context dependent. The rules can be modified to explore 
\emph on
what if
\emph default
 scenarios via stochastic simulation and eventually aggregated to offer insights on dynamic and spatial control measures. They tend to be most expressive when the number of individuals are low and stochastic effects become significant and observable (e.g., a countable population of whales). But estimating these rules is a challenge due to the open-ended and contingent manner in which they apply to a particular set of environmental conditions, in a particular population, with a particular phylogenetic history, surrounded by predators and prey that are themselves also subject to their own particularities. Their open-endedness means that some other factor may have been missed or misrepresented and so inferences are difficult to generalize beyond the model domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Mechanistic
\emph default
 models with some intermediate number of subcomponents, therefore, represent a reasoned balance between number of components and number of interactions. Their focus is upon the manner in which the mean (and sometimes the variability) changes with time, usually specified by differential equations. Identifying informative subcomponents is dependent upon the peculiarities of a particular system (species or population) that permit useful abstraction or simplifying assumptions. The drawback of these models is that they still require a lot of information and skill to parameterize them, and information that is usually not available or observable, causing assumptions to be made that are not always justified.

discrete logistic map
\emph default
 is often represented as a Euler approximation of the logistic differential equation, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\frac{\mathit{dZ}}{\mathit{dt}}=r}Z{({{1-Z}K^{-1}})}$
\end_inset

. Normalization of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $z={Z/K}$
\end_inset

 allows simplification to: 
\begin_inset Formula ${\frac{\mathit{dz}}{\mathit{dt}}=r}z{({1-z})}.$
\end_inset

 The Euler approximation for a small increment of time 
\begin_inset Formula ${\tau_{t+1}={\tau_{t}+\Delta}}\tau$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 in the next time interval is estimated as: 
\begin_inset Formula ${z_{t+1}={z_{t}+\Delta}}\tau\cdot\frac{\mathit{dz}}{\mathit{dt}}{}_{z_{t}}$
\end_inset

, which upon substitution of the differential equation and simplification gives: 
\begin_inset Formula ${z_{t+1}={({{1+\Delta}\tau r})}}{z_{t}-\Delta}\tau r{z_{t}}^{2}$
\end_inset

. The identities: 
\begin_inset Formula ${\rho={1+\Delta}}\tau r,$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula ${n_{t}=\frac{\Delta\tau rz_{t}}{\rho}},$
\end_inset

 help to simplify further: 
\begin_inset Formula ${n_{t+1}=\frac{\Delta\tau rz_{t+1}}{\rho}}.$
\end_inset

 Substitution of the identity of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 to gives: 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{t+1}={}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula ${\frac{\Delta\tau r{({{({{1+\Delta}\tau r})}{z_{t}-\Delta}\tau r{z_{t}}^{2}})}}{\rho}=\rho}n_{t}{({1-n_{t}})}.$
\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula ${1+\mathit{rescaled}}{(r)}$
\end_inset

, where recalled means it is a fractional change relative to the previous 
\emph on
time step
\emph default
. Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 are rescaled values of z, more meaningful with a time step of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

. Importantly, this derivation is for infinitesimal changes in time. If the increment in time is relatively large, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta{t=1}\mathit{year}$
\end_inset

, as it is commonly used in fisheries applications, the 
\emph on
infinitesimal
\emph default
 change assumption is not biologically reasonable.
