# Dynamical models for fishery assessment made possible by [Julia](https://julialang.org/), [SciML](https://sciml.ai/) and [Turing](https://turing.ml/).

[Current results based upon this developmental branch are found here.](snowcrab/snowcrab_results_current.md)


They are generated by the [main program here.](snowcrab/README.md)

An example using this approach is found in (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.13.528296v3) for **snowcrab** -- now grafted onto bio.snowcrab for operational work (Jan 2023)

Models currently implemented:

- discrete logistic (Euler form) 

- discrete logistic map 

- six size-stage continuous delay difference  




Example data are in RData form: 

    - [biodyn_number_size_struct.RData](snowcrab/data/biodyn_number_size_struct.RData) 
        
        - time series by large areal units, number, size, habitat, etc.

        - used by stage structured models

    - [biodyn_biomass.RData](snowcrab/data/biodyn_biomass.RData) 
        
        - time series by large areal units in biomass 

        - used by logistic models
