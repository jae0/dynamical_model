# dynamical_model

Dynamical and spatiotemporal models for fishery assessment in Julia

**snowcrab** (dynamical only): -- now grafted onto bio.snowcrab (Jan 2023) .. this is here as a seprate form for exploratory work

- discrete logistic (Euler)
- discrete logistic map
- six size-stage continuous delay difference

**car** (spatial only):

- for reference
- Scottish lip cancer data to verify results

**spacetime**:

- combine car with dynamical models (todo))
